# open-claude-code

This is an open-source implementation of Claude Code based on our reverse engineering analysis.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the core functionality of Claude Code, including:

- Agent framework
- Message queue system
- Tool execution framework
- Basic Read tool implementation

## Current Status

This is an early-stage implementation. Many features from the original Claude Code are not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

1. Implement h2A asynchronous message queue
2. Add more tools (Write, Bash, Grep, etc.)
3. Implement security features
4. Add memory and context management

Check the [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) file for more details about the project.
